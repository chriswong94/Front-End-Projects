Pagination Filter
================================
In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that has too much information. 
To make it easier to read the page, you'll use progressive enhancement to add pagination.
Also, you could find the information easily by searching in the 'Search bar' on the head of page.

## Requirements
The program will display 10 students out of 54 per page,and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students. (Code also work for any number of student listings, whether there were 5, 25, 55 or 100 student listings.)

- [X] The program calculates the number of pages needed and add the appropriate number of links to the bottom of the page.

- [X] When the page loads, the page will hide all but what will show on the first page, which will be the first 10 students in the list.

- [X] When a user clicks on “2” in the pagination, students 11 through 20 are shown. When a user clicks “3”, students 21 through 30 are shown. And so on.


A search bar was added (dynamically created and appended) to let users search the list of students for a particular student or students.

- [X] When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search value. (list all students whose name or email includes search value.)

- [X] Paginate search results. Display pagination links based on how many search results are returned.

- [X] Handle no results returned. If no matches are found by the search, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
